Customer Churn Prediction

Introduction

Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers likely to stop using a product or service. By analyzing customer behavior, demographics, and interactions, businesses can take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve customer satisfaction.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical data. This helps businesses reduce churn rates, optimize customer retention strategies, and increase profitability.

Dataset

The dataset used contains customer information such as demographics, usage behavior, and service details.

The target variable is a binary indicator where 1 represents a churned customer and 0 represents an active customer.

Technologies Used

Python: Programming Language

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
